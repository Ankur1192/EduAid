# EduAid means Education Aid with Augmented Reality 
This website enables us to learn the concepts with 3D models, which makes our understanding easier. AR models of concepts make understanding faster with brief and accurate definitions.

This is the website where you can learn about subjects using Augumented reality.
Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory.
When you go to any sub-topic, you will find "Experience the model using AR. If you go there, you will find a QR code. When you scan it,you can see the AR visual of the model On our website, you can learn by analyzing the visualizations of real-time models using AR.
